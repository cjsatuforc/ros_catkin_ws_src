    Returns a LocationGlobal object containing the latitude/longitude `dNorth` and `dEast` metres from the

    The function is useful when you want to move the vehicle around specifying locations relative to 
    the current vehicle position.
    The algorithm is relatively accurate over small distances (10m within 1km) except close to the poles.
